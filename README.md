## Introduction

This is a system that will monitor the water levels of a river/lake/stream and predicts the occurrence of a flood and generate an alert accordingly. This system would not only measure the water level but also the water velocity in order to give a better prediction of the risky situations.

 

[Background work](http://www.irrigation.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_riverdata&Itemid=266&lang=en)

Currently, this site gives an update of the river status of Sri Lanka. However this system is based on manually collected data and is updated only once per day. By constantly keeping track of this site we found that there are certain times that the system doesnâ€™t output any data at all. Due to these reasons we proposed a sensor based flood alert system through water level and velocity monitoring.

This project will be covering aspects from embedded systems (CO321), Network and web application design (CO324), Computer and network security (CO325)
